Here, I present my personal portfolio, created using HTML and CSS.
I have implemented various HTML tags and added creative animations using keyframes and visual effects on hover to make the website stylish and attractive. 
In the design, I extensively used grids and flexboxes to easily position elements on the page.
My portfolio includes working links and buttons, providing navigation and convenience for users.
In the header of the page, I placed links that direct visitors to specific content sections.
Additionally, in this project, I provided information about myself and the work I completed during my learning period.
This allows visitors to learn more about my skills and experience.
The end result is not only a structured and informative resource but also an example of a creative approach to web design and development,
making it appealing to potential employers and clients.
